<summary>Summary for commit 8 (f04aff5944ec15fe4bb351a2b83d19141994178b)</summary>

The commit by Neptune (f04aff5) involves two changes in the codebase:

1. In the `screenpipe-audio/tests/windows_output_device_tests.rs` file, an import statement has been modified to include an additional module, `AudioInput`.

2. In the `screenpipe-core/tests/pipes_test.rs` file, a test function named `test_js_execution` has been removed. This test was an asynchronous function, marked to be ignored during regular test runs, and involved executing JavaScript code, writing it to a file, and testing JavaScript execution using a function `run_js`. The function was also asserting the success of the execution and performing clean-up by removing the created file.

In summary, the commit primarily removes a specific JavaScript execution test and updates an import in a Windows output device test file.

<details>
<summary>Summary for commit 9 (ddde3083886f043a71a26b6f895e197ac517733f)</summary>

The commit by Louis Beaumont modifies the `pre_build.js` script in the `screenpipe-app-tauri` project. The update includes adding a check for the `SKIP_SCREENPIPE_SETUP` environment variable both in the sections for Linux and Windows platforms. If this environment variable is set, the script will skip the file copying process by setting `copied` to true and breaking out of the loop early. This is part of an attempt to fix the Windows build, as denoted by the commit message "42th attempt to fix windows build."
</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<details>
<summary>Summary for commit 10 (d4c7f7d36b1fa816f593c67f649b0f9584ead26c)</summary>

The commit `d4c7f7d36b1fa816f593c67f649b0f9584ead26c` by Louis Beaumont aims to resolve issues with building on Windows. Key changes include:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow (`release-app.yml`):**
    - The `needs` keyword for the `publish-tauri` job is modified by uncommenting it.
    - The `sudo chmod -R 755 ./scripts/pre_build.js` command is removed, likely to avoid unnecessary file modifications or permission issues.

2. **JavaScript Script (`pre_build.js`):**
    - The script `copyDenoBinary` no longer explicitly uses `fs.chmod` to set permissions right after copying the file. Instead, it uses a new function `copyFile`.
    - Introduced error handling for `EPERM` errors to handle permission issues by attempting an elevated copy using a new function `elevatedCopy` on Windows. This function uses PowerShell to execute the copy command with elevated permissions.
    - Created helper functions `copyFile` and `elevatedCopy` to encapsulate file copying and permission handling. These functions ensure the file is executable by setting its mode to 755.
    - Improved error messaging for unexpected errors, providing more clarity by logging the error message and exiting the process.

These changes indicate an effort to improve cross-platform compatibility, focusing on handling permissions effectively on Windows systems.

1. Modification of the GitHub Actions workflow configuration file (`.github/workflows/release-app.yml`):
   - The installation step for Scoop on Windows has been removed.
   - There is a change to the permissions for the `pre_build.js` script, using `sudo chmod -R 755 ./scripts/pre_build.js` to ensure it has the correct permissions before it's executed.
   - Simplified running of the `pre_build.js` script by removing redundant commands and comments.
   - The section to run `pre_build.js` as a separate step after the build has been consolidated to match the pattern used earlier.

2. Update to the version number in the `Cargo.toml` file located in `screenpipe-app-tauri/src-tauri/`:
   - The version was incremented from "0.3.5" to "0.3.6".

These changes suggest improvements to streamline the build process and possibly address issues found specifically in the Windows environment.

<summary>Summary for commit 14 (95b7569d11b67fb0a04901f892c0b9c035ad0474)</summary>

The commit labeled "fix: windows build" introduces several changes to improve the build process on Windows systems:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: The setup for a tmate session, which was previously enabled for Windows platforms in the `release-app.yml` workflow, has been commented out. This might remove a workaround or debugging step previously used for remote debugging during CI runs on Windows.

2. **Documentation Update**: In the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, instructions for using tmate sessions for debugging GitHub Actions on Windows have been added. This includes an example snippet for setting up tmate and a link to the `act` tool for local GitHub Actions testing.

3. **Script Adjustment**: In the `pre_build.js` script, unnecessary commands used for logging potential deno installation directories were removed. Additionally, the path used for checking the Deno installation on Windows was changed from a binary path to a tools directory path (`C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\lib\\deno\\tools`).

4. **Version Bump**: The version of the `screenpipe-app` was incremented from `0.3.4` to `0.3.5` in the `Cargo.toml` file, likely reflecting the build fix or small updates without major changes.

<summary>Summary for commit 17 (53581c61d6b17ceeca039bfd1260255b161d538a)</summary>

The commit made by Neptune, identified by hash `53581c61d6b17ceeca039bfd1260255b161d538a`, aimed at removing all warnings from the code, involves several changes across different files:

1. **`screenpipe-audio/src/core.rs`**: 
   - Added a line in non-macOS systems to handle an "unused variable" warning by assigning the `name` variable to `_`, effectively marking it as intentionally unused.

2. **`screenpipe-core/src/ffmpeg.rs`**: 
   - Removed conditional imports and constants related to Windows-specific functionality (`CommandExt` and `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`). These removals likely address unused code warnings for non-Windows builds.

3. **`screenpipe-server/src/resource_monitor.rs`**: 
   - Moved the import of the `Command` struct to be conditional on macOS, potentially resolving an unused import warning on platforms that are not macOS.

4. **`screenpipe-vision/build.rs`**: 
   - Wrapped `use std::env` and `use std::path::PathBuf` with a macOS-specific `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` conditional to avoid unused import warnings on platforms other than macOS.

These changes demonstrate an effort to clean up the code by resolving warnings about unused variables, imports, and platform-specific code not being applicable in certain contexts.

<summary>Summary for commit 19 (1b08db72085d3f8dff7d285bc4f788fdd4da62c2)</summary>

The commit `1b08db72085d3f8dff7d285bc4f788fdd4da62c2` authored by Louis Beaumont introduces a new feature to the `screenpipe-js` project. Specifically, the addition of a `pipe.inbox` functionality.

### Key Changes:
- The `PipeConfig` interface has been updated to allow values of any type (`any`) instead of just `object`, `string`, `number`, or `boolean`.
- New interfaces `InboxMessage` and `InboxMessageAction` are defined for handling inbox messages:
  - `InboxMessage` includes properties `title`, `body`, and an optional `actions`.
  - `InboxMessageAction` consists of `label` and `action`.
- A new `inbox` object within `pipe` is added, featuring a `send` function:
  - This asynchronous function takes a message of type `InboxMessage` and sends it to an inbox endpoint.
  - The endpoint is determined by the environment variable `SCREENPIPE_SERVER_URL` or defaults to `"http://localhost:11435"`.
  - The function returns a boolean indicating the success of the message delivery.
  - Any errors during the message sending process are logged to the console.

<summary>Summary for commit 20 (e617bf421fe10033a17bb73247d4d5a7a2086ea0)</summary>

The commit `e617bf4` by Louis Beaumont modifies the `pre_build.js` script to fix issues with building on Windows by adjusting how the Deno tool is installed. The previous approach attempted to install Deno using Scoop first, then Chocolatey as a fallback. This commit changes the approach:

1. **Deno Installation**: It now attempts to install or upgrade Deno using Chocolatey directly instead of using Scoop. The command used is `choco upgrade deno -y`, ensuring that Deno is installed or upgraded if it already exists.

2. **Debugging Information**: The updated script includes commands to list potential directories after the installation for debugging purposes, providing source paths to verify where Deno might be installed.

3. **Deno Binary Source Check**: The script checks for the Deno binary in the `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\deno.exe` location instead of looking into Scoop paths. 

4. **Command Fix**: It adjusts a command to find Deno in the system PATH, using `where deno` instead of `which deno`, which is more suitable for Windows systems.

Overall, the changes focus on using Chocolatey for consistent and reliable installation and upgrade of Deno on Windows systems while removing Scoop-related logic and updating system PATH checks.

<summary>Summary for commit 21 (c27c5746b1ffddb3aec1e4a0ff9cfba4dbd72fd5)</summary>

The git commit `c27c5746b1ffddb3aec1e4a0ff9cfba4dbd72fd5` by Louis Beaumont addresses an issue with the Windows build process for the `screenpipe-app-tauri` project. Specifically, in the `scripts/pre_build.js` file, two lines were removed where an error message was logged to the console if installing Deno via PowerShell failed. This indicates that the script now skips the step of reporting the failure directly and proceeds to try installing Deno using Scoop without logging the PowerShell error.
</details>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<details>
<summary>Summary for commit 22 (c071cf9afc20d77d14ab3f890cdf1451866760a2)</summary>

The git commit by Louis Beaumont makes changes to improve the Windows build process for a project. The updated code performs the following actions:

1. **GitHub Workflow Update**:  
   - The `release-app.yml` workflow configuration file is modified to include a step that installs Scoop, a package manager for Windows, if the current platform is `windows-latest`. This is based on a conditional check within the workflow.

2. **JavaScript Script Update (`pre_build.js`)**:
   - The script responsible for installing Deno, a JavaScript runtime, is revised:
     - Removed the attempt to install Deno using `winget` and a PowerShell script. The new approach prioritizes installation via Scoop.
     - The installation order now attempts with Scoop first, then falls back to Chocolatey if the initial attempt fails.
     - Cleaned up redundant or unsuccessful methods of installing Deno.
   - For the path handling:
     - The script now checks for Deno’s installation primarily in the Scoop and Chocolatey locations, removing checks for Winget and a home directory path.

The overall aim is to streamline and ensure the Deno installation process on Windows systems using more reliable means, addressing issues with previous methods.

<summary>Summary for commit 23 (d77b3570ff03ff0f69c1d5c00d3bfae6f0ed8503)</summary>

The recent commit d77b3570 introduces changes to the `pre_build.js` script to improve the installation process of Deno on Windows. The update adds alternative methods for installing Deno if the initial attempt using PowerShell fails:

1. **Added Installation Methods**:
   - Adds attempts to install Deno using `scoop`.
   - Adds attempts to install Deno using `chocolatey` if both PowerShell and scoop installations fail.

2. **Updated Binary Search Paths**:
   - Includes checking additional paths where Deno might be installed:
     - `scoop` installation path.
     - `chocolatey` installation path.

If all automated installation methods fail, the script prompts the user to install Deno manually. This update is aimed at improving the robustness of the script when building the application on Windows environments.

<summary>Summary for commit 34 (73891dda844f19afe1ac7dbcf675a26dff0fb699)</summary>

The commit improves the installation process of the Deno runtime on Windows systems within the `pre_build.js` script of a Tauri application. It introduces a more robust method to handle Deno installation by first attempting to use `winget`, Microsoft's package manager, and falling back to using a PowerShell script if `winget` fails. Additionally, it enhances the handling of Deno's binary location by checking both the `winget` installation path and the user's home directory. Error handling and console messages are also improved to give clearer feedback when installation paths or binaries are not found.

<summary>Summary for commit 35 (c14bd49d5c2154381c1673b5927ccc6535f98e5a)</summary>

The git commit `c14bd49d5c2154381c1673b5927ccc6535f98e5a` by Louis Beaumont addresses a fix for building on macOS in the `pre_build.js` script of the `screenpipe-app-tauri` project. 

### Summary of Changes:
- **Multiplatform Handling for Deno Binary:**
  - Previously, the script distinguished binaries based on architecture (ARM vs. Intel) for macOS but only supported copying to one destination.
  - Now the script explicitly supports two destination paths on macOS: one for ARM (`deno-aarch64-apple-darwin`) and another for Intel (`deno-x86_64-apple-darwin`). Thus, ensuring that binaries for both architectures are copied and made executable.
- **Updating the Command for Finding Deno:**
  - The command used to find the `deno` binary in the system's PATH is changed from `where` to `which`, which is appropriate for Unix-like systems including macOS.
  
These changes ensure the script correctly handles both architectures on macOS, enhancing compatibility and fixing the build process.

<summary>Summary for commit 36 (ec948962312ac3163b270654ff6e8f999a33c358)</summary>

The recent commit identified by hash `ec948962312ac3163b270654ff6e8f999a33c358` addresses issues with the macOS build process in the `screenpipe-app-tauri` project. 

Key changes are:

1. **Enhancements in `copyDenoBinary` function:**
   - Before trying to copy the Deno binary file, the code now checks if the source file exists.
   - If the source file is not found (`ENOENT` error), it attempts to locate the `deno` binary by searching the system PATH.
   - If a binary is found in the PATH, it copies it to the destination and sets the necessary execution permissions.
   - Additional error handling is included to inform the user if Deno is not installed or accessible in the PATH.

2. **Path Adjustments for Linux Platform:**
   - Updated one of the potential paths for locating the `screenpipe` executable, changing it from four directories up and two down to four directories up and one down in the path hierarchy.

These changes improve the robustness of the build process, especially in ensuring the necessary binaries are available and helping users to locate missing dependencies.

<summary>Summary for commit 37 (7a0fba41b65669cd94947da5555ba0a913c9486f)</summary>

The commit by Louis Beaumont addresses issues with building on macOS. The key changes include:

1. **`.gitignore` Update**: Added `*src-tauri/deno*` to the `.gitignore` file to exclude Deno-related files in the `src-tauri` directory.

2. **Script Modification (`pre_build.js`)**:
   - The script now correctly checks the platform name as 'macos' instead of 'darwin'.
   - Introduced a more robust method to read the machine architecture using a `TextDecoder`.
   - Ensures that the copied Deno binary is executable by adding a `chmod` operation (`0o755`) after copying.
   - Made minor logging and whitespace adjustments for clarity.

Overall, these changes improve compatibility and functionality of the build process, particularly for macOS.

<summary>Summary for commit 38 (bfe86a8f1db1eebaff33c09d4e4d635b21d529f2)</summary>

The git commit by Louis Beaumont on October 10, 2024, contains changes to a JavaScript script related to a Tauri application. The specific modifications include updates to the `copyDenoBinary` function, which is responsible for copying the Deno binary files needed for different operating systems.

### Key Changes:
1. **Function Enhancement**: 
   - The function `copyDenoBinary` was expanded to handle platform-specific paths and filenames for copying the Deno binary.
   
2. **Platform Handling**:
   - For **Windows**: The source and destination paths for the Deno binary were specified clearly.
   - For **macOS (Darwin)**: The script now determines whether the machine is ARM or Intel-based and sets the destination path accordingly (`aarch64` for ARM and `x86_64` for Intel).
   - For **Linux**: It sets the destination path with a specific format for Linux systems.
   - An error message is logged for unsupported platforms, replacing the previous approach that assumed support for other platforms.

3. **Logging**:
   - Enhanced logging to confirm the successful copy of the Deno binary and provide detailed error messages in case of failure.

These improvements make the script more robust and platform-aware, ensuring that the correct Deno binary is used on different systems.

<summary>Summary for commit 40 (d211cd7a5c21bc07a664f30c9f62d178ec128211)</summary>

The commit `d211cd7a5c21bc07a664f30c9f62d178ec128211` introduces several key changes primarily related to the handling and usage of Deno for the Screenpipe project. Here is a summary of the main changes:

1. **Removal of Existing Implementations**:
    - Several TypeScript example pipes under the `examples/typescript` directory are removed. These include `pipe-activity-topic-tracker`, `pipe-focus-notification-buddy`, `pipe-llama32-comment-linear-while-you-work`, `pipe-llama32-sync-user-conversation-to-notion`, `pipe-meeting-summary-by-email`, `pipe-phi3.5-engineering-team-logs`, `pipe-post-questions-on-reddit`, `pipe-screen-to-crm`, `pipe-security-check`, `pipe-stream-ocr-text`, and `pipe-sync-meetings-to-notion`.
    - Corresponding README files, TypeScript configuration files, and deno.lock files are also removed.

2. **Introduction of Deno**:
    - The project now integrates Deno by introducing `deno.json` files to facilitate module imports and tasks.
    - Scripts and configurations that handle the setup and execution of Deno are added, including logic to install Deno and copy its binaries for different operating systems via the `scripts/pre_build.js` file in the `screenpipe-app-tauri` directory.
    
3. **Core Architectural Changes**:
    - The Rust-based runtime engine for pipes (using Deno) as previously encapsulated in `deno_core` and `deno_ast` dependencies, and corresponding code (like `runtime.js`) is removed.
    - A shift towards using standalone scripts to manage what was previously potentially within custom runtimes or tightly integrated plugins.

4. **New Pipe Examples**:
    - Introduction of new example pipes such as:
        - `simple-node-api-pipe`: This involves a task configuration using `deno` for Node.js API interaction.
        - `simple-ollama-pipe`: Demonstrates a simple chat pipe using the Ollama AI provider.
        - `simple-pipe-api-pipe`: A setup to execute a pipe via API access.

5. **Use of External Packages**:
    - The examples now utilize packages from `npm` such as `zod` for schemas, `ai` for AI interactions, `ollama-ai-provider` for using Ollama AI providers through Deno.

6. **Refactoring of Load and Execution Logic**:
    - The way pipes are managed, downloaded, and executed has been overhauled. Rust functions are updated to utilize Deno for running and managing pipes, evidenced in the changes within `pipes.rs`.

7. **Configuration Updates**:
    - The `Cargo.toml` across core, server, and app components show adjustments in feature flags related to pipes.
    - There has been a shift from a tightly coupled JavaScript environment within Rust processes to utilizing Deno directly for easier management of JavaScript/TypeScript execution.

Overall, these changes denote a significant restructuring towards utilizing Deno for handling script execution within the project, moving away from custom-crafted runtime JavaScript executions towards a more modular and native approach using Deno and TypeScript directly.

<summary>Summary for commit 41 (49381440335c1c96a954af8a0ab26a0c69011bcd)</summary>

The git commit by Louis Beaumont, made on October 10, 2024, introduces changes to the `opentelemetry.ts` file in the `screenpipe-app-tauri/lib` directory. The changes include adding a conditional check at the beginning of the `initOpenTelemetry` function. It now checks if the `TAURI_ENV_DEBUG` environment variable is set to "true" or if the `window.origin` includes "localhost". If either condition is met, the function returns early, effectively skipping the initialization of OpenTelemetry in those cases. This likely aims to prevent OpenTelemetry from running in debug or local development environments.

<summary>Summary for commit 42 (8125b9e43bba9d938779d7d28cae3fb218643d82)</summary>

The commit made by Louis Beaumont adds a new feature, referred to as a "linear pipe," which is not yet complete. The changes include:

1. **Cargo.toml Modifications**: 
    - A new profile `[profile.dev-release]` is added, which inherits settings from `[profile.release]` but sets `lto` (Link Time Optimization) to `false`.

2. **New Example: `pipe-llama32-comment-linear-while-you-work`**:
    - A new directory with typescript examples is introduced. It contains files like `README.md`, `pipe.json`, `pipe.ts`, `screenpipe.d.ts`, and `tsconfig.json`.
    - The purpose of this example is to automate comments on Linear tasks based on screen activity.
    - Descriptions and setup instructions are provided in `README.md`.
    - The TypeScript files outline the implementation of a system that uses screen data to generate Linear task comments using an AI model (`llama3.2`) and communicate with their APIs.

3. **Updates to Existing Example**: 
    - Modifications are made to the `pipe.ts` files within the `pipe-phi3.5-engineering-team-logs` example. These changes involve refactoring the way screen data is queried by using the `pipe.queryScreenpipe` method instead of manual HTTP requests.

4. **Enhancements in Core Runtime**:
    - A new function `extractJsonFromLlmResponse` is added to handle extraction of JSON data from AI model responses that may contain formatting issues.
    - Improvements are made to error logging in `pipes.rs`, adding more detailed error information and backtrace to help diagnose issues when errors occur in the JavaScript runtime or during module evaluation.

These changes collectively introduce a partially complete feature geared towards automating task management and improve existing functionality and error handling in the system.
