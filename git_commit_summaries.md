The commit `e246af893ac1516665370d2b8401138e85d4b3af` by Louis Beaumont updates the version of `@screenpipe/js` from `0.1.2` to `0.1.3` across several `package.json` files in different directories. Specifically, the version bump appears in the dependencies of the following packages:

1. `pipe-anthropic-computer-use-meeting-assistant`
2. `pipe-email-exa-search`
3. `pipe-llama32-comment-linear-while-you-work`
4. `pipe-notion-table-logs`
5. `pipe-obsidian-time-logs` (upgraded from `0.1.1` to `0.1.3`)
6. `pipe-post-questions-on-reddit`
7. `pipe-screen-time-storyteller`

Additionally, in the `screenpipe-js/main.ts` file, changes were made to improve the way the configuration path is determined. The path now falls back to the current directory if environment variables are not set. The version of `@screenpipe/js` was updated to `0.1.3` in its own `package.json` file as well.

<summary>summary for commit 2 (0bbcfd0b1910ec9c1da0b643496909f982ba2ce4)</summary>

This commit, authored by Louis Beaumont, updates the `create-pipe` script in the `screenpipe-js` project to include more detailed instructions on how to run the project. Specifically, the instructions now highlight alternative commands for using different package managers, such as `npm`, `pnpm`, and `yarn`, in addition to `bun`. The changes are as follows:

1. In `index.ts`, updated the console instructions during the `main` function:
   - Added comments instructing users that instead of `bun install`, they can use `npm install`, `pnpm install`, or `yarn install`.
   - Similar instructions were added for `bun dev`, suggesting alternatives like `npm run dev`, `pnpm dev`, or `yarn dev`.
   - For `bun run pipe.ts`, suggested alternatives like `npm run pipe.ts`, `pnpm pipe.ts`, or `yarn pipe.ts`.

2. In `package.json`, the version was incremented from `0.0.7` to `0.0.8`.

<summary>summary for commit 3 (4e67768198e22bad2cebd75427b2ea51ff84fe39)</summary>

This commit, authored by Louis Beaumont on December 7, 2024, involves a series of changes focused on fixing database migrations and incrementing the version of a package. Here is a summary of the changes:

1. **Version Update**:
   - The version of the `screenpipe-app` package in `Cargo.toml` is updated from `0.14.31` to `0.14.32`.

2. **Database Migration Changes**:
   - The database migration handling in `screenpipe-server/src/db.rs` was modified to simplify error handling and introduce a new method for migration. The specific change involves setting `ignore_missing` to `true` in the migration setup, removing the manual error handling for a known migration mismatch.

3. **Migration Files Updated**:
   - Two migration files were removed:
     - `20241110041538_add_speaker_id_to_transcription.sql` and `20241126220600_ensure_speaker_id_column.sql`
     - These files previously attempted to add a `speaker_id` column to the `audio_transcriptions` table by checking if the column existed before performing the alter operation.

4. **Migration Files Added**:
   - A new migration file `20241127172038_create_speaker_id_col_final.sql` was introduced. It creates a new table `audio_transcriptions_new`, migrates data from `audio_transcriptions` with a new `speaker_id` column set to `NULL`, and then renames the new table to replace the old one.
   - Another new migration file `20241127220428_add_hallucination_column.sql` was added to introduce a new `hallucination` column to the `speakers` table, defaulting to `FALSE`.

Overall, these changes consolidate the migration process by eliminating previously existing checks and restructuring how the `speaker_id` column is added, along with introducing a new column for tracking hallucinations in the `speakers` table.

<summary>summary for commit 8 (b98897fa53bc24ebddf531f328b3457224f0e436)</summary>

The git commit with hash `b98897fa53bc24ebddf531f328b3457224f0e436`, authored by Louis Beaumont, includes several changes aimed at fixing issues related to the loom button and Windows build for the `release-app`. Specifically:

1. **Workflow Updates**: 
   - The GitHub Actions workflow file `release-app.yml` was modified to update how `wget` is installed on Windows. Now, `winget` is used to install `wget` silently, replacing the previous method of manual downloading. The pre-build script is unified for both Windows and non-Windows after this change.

2. **Code Improvements and Refactoring**:
   - In `providers.tsx`, the `Providers` component is now wrapped in a `forwardRef`, and its display name is set for better debugging and readability.
   - A console log typo was corrected in `notification-handler.tsx` from "notification permission" to "ission".
   - In `pipe-store.tsx`, logic was added to handle loom subscription checks before enabling a specific pipe, and there was a minor UI adjustment by removing the `size="icon"` attribute.

3. **Subscription Logic**:
   - The `StripeSubscriptionButton` component has enhanced logic to check for user subscriptions using `checkLoomSubscription`. The button is now conditionally rendered based on subscription status, and the text is simplified.

4. **Console Log Cleanup**:
   - Removed some diagnostic console log statements across various files to clean up the code.

5. **Dependency and Version Updates**:
   - The version of the package `screenpipe-app` was incremented, reflected in `Cargo.lock` updated from `0.14.27` to `0.14.28` and `Cargo.toml` from `0.14.28` to `0.14.29`.

<summary>summary for commit 9 (d2ba0c6d919ddc56017e8e0c32f6b1beafd83d9a)</summary>

The commit introduces a new feature for handling cron job execution timing in a manner similar to Vercel's approach, specifically by persisting state to disk. The changes include:

1. **Addition of Functions**:
   - `get_last_cron_execution`: This function retrieves the last execution time of a cron job from a persisted state file (`.cron_state.json`). It returns this time as a `SystemTime` if it exists.
   - `save_cron_execution`: This function saves the current time as the last execution time of a cron job into the state file, ensuring the cron state is up-to-date.

2. **Enhancements in `run_cron_schedule`**:
   - The function now retrieves the pipe directory for state persistence and fetches the last execution time.
   - It updates logic to calculate the next scheduled run based on the last execution time, allowing for more accurate scheduling.

3. **Testing Enhancements**:
   - Added new tests to verify cron state persistence:
     - `test_cron_state_persistence` tests saving and reading execution times.
     - `test_cron_scheduling` simulates cron job execution timing and verifies correct scheduling intervals.
     - `test_cron_recovery_after_restart` ensures that cron jobs can accurately recover their schedule after a restart by checking the previously persisted execution time.

These changes improve the cron scheduling system by making it resilient to restarts and ensuring accurate timing through state persistence.

<summary>summary for commit 10 (7a88b075cc2fda001e6f9cbd3a912bcd909cad9a)</summary>

The commit with hash `7a88b075cc2fda001e6f9cbd3a912bcd909cad9a` by Louis Beaumont on December 6, 2024, makes adjustments to the `release-app.yml` GitHub workflow file to improve the process on Windows. Specifically:

1. Unnecessary trailing spaces were removed from several lines, which helps in maintaining a cleaner code style.

2. The section for installing `wget` was updated:
   - Previously, `wget` was installed using Chocolatey. This involved setting the execution policy, downloading the Chocolatey install script, and then using Chocolatey to install `wget`.
   - The update replaces this with a direct download of `wget` from a specific URL (`https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/1.21.4/64/wget.exe`) using a WebClient in PowerShell. The downloaded `wget` executable is saved directly to `C:\Windows\System32\wget.exe`.

These changes streamline the installation of `wget` by removing the dependence on Chocolatey, possibly reducing setup time and potential issues related to Chocolatey installation.

<summary>summary for commit 11 (9dc6d3b3fdfde4588c2cdb1aecf1cf1066660178)</summary>

The commit with hash `9dc6d3b3fdfde4588c2cdb1aecf1cf1066660178` adds a feature to implement Vercel-like cron job capabilities in the Next.js handling of the `pipes` module within the `screenpipe-core` project.

### Changes Made:
1. **Dependencies:**
   - Added two new dependencies in `Cargo.toml`: `cron` (for scheduling) version `0.13.0` and `chrono` (for date and time handling) version `0.4.38`.

2. **Code Enhancements:**
   - Introduced a function to generate a secure random secret for cron jobs.
   - Inside the existing function that handles Next.js pipes, additional logic was added to:
     - Check for cron jobs (`crons`) in the configuration.
     - Generate and store a `CRON_SECRET`.
     - Validate the cron job schedule format.
     - Use `tokio` asynchronous tasks to schedule and execute the cron jobs based on the defined schedule.
   - Implemented `run_cron_schedule`, an asynchronous function that:
     - Waits until the next scheduled time.
     - Executes an HTTP GET request with an authorization header to a given path using the cron schedule.

3. **Cron Job Execution:**
   - The cron job execution is handled in an asynchronous loop that:
     - Calculates the time until the next scheduled execution.
     - Logs the execution attempt.
     - Sends a request to the specified endpoint and handles errors if they occur.

### Summary:
This update implements support for cron jobs within the Next.js handling in the `pipes` module, allowing for server-side scheduled tasks using cron-like expressions. It uses the `cron` and `chrono` crates for schedule parsing and timing and performs execution tasks asynchronously with the `tokio` runtime.

This commit involves several updates and fixes across different components of a GitHub project, focusing on the "release-app" workflow and the "screenpipe-app-tauri" application. 

1. **GitHub Workflow Update**: 
   - The `release-app.yml` GitHub Actions workflow now includes separate steps for running a script (`pre_build.js`) on Windows and non-Windows platforms. 
   - For Windows, it installs `wget` via Chocolatey and executes the script with modified environment settings.

2. **Header Component Adjustments**: 
   - In `header.tsx`, a new icon `User` from `lucide-react` is imported and used in place of the `Avatar` component for user menu buttons. 
   - Some CSS classes for button styling have been slightly adjusted.

3. **Pipe Store Component Refactor**: 
   - The `pipe-store.tsx` component now uses HTTP requests instead of the `Command.sidecar` for operations like listing, downloading, updating, and toggling pipes.
   - The REST API endpoints are utilized to interact with the backend (`localhost:3030`) for better maintainability and flexibility.
   - Additional error handling is implemented for user actions such as downloading or enabling pipes.

4. **Version Increment**:
   - The application's version is updated from `0.14.27` to `0.14.28` in the `Cargo.toml` and from `0.14.26` to `0.14.27` in `Cargo.lock`.

5. **Cargo Dependencies Reorganization**:
   - Some dependencies have been shifted around within `Cargo.toml`, moving those related to permissions hacks (e.g., `scap`, `nokhwa-bindings-macos`, `tauri-nspanel`) under specific target configurations.

Overall, these changes aim to improve the build process, refactor existing code for better readability and maintainability, and increment the application version to reflect these updates.

<summary>summary for commit 13 (594be5342bda75bba1f5e1d8e87e8bc41b14a3c6)</summary>

The git commit made by Louis Beaumont on December 6, 2024, involves the following changes:

1. **Deletion of Documents**:
   - Two files, `README-ja_JP.md` (Japanese) and `README-zh_CN.md` (Simplified Chinese), have been deleted entirely from the repository.

2. **Modification of README.md**:
   - The language selection links at the top, specifically the links to the deleted Japanese and Chinese README files, have been removed from `README.md`.

3. **Modifications in the Documentation**:
   - In `content/docs/pages/docs/getting-started.mdx`, the onboarding link was updated by removing the explicit path reference (`/onboarding`) and simplifying it to just `https://screenpi.pe`.
   - In `content/docs/pages/index.mdx`, an embedded YouTube video iframe and a link to "Download Desktop App" were removed. The document now includes information without the video and streamlines the next steps to getting started, plugins, and examples.

4. **Update in Obsidian Plugin Archive**:
   - In `pipes/archive/meeting-summaries-in-obsidian/README.md`, the link for getting the example has been updated by simplifying the URL, removing the `/onboarding` suffix.

These changes likely aim to remove outdated localized documentation and streamline user access to the desktop app and associated resources.

<summary>summary for commit 14 (e54e3ded2c1d9609ac81d008f39e0476e6b76278)</summary>

The commit made by Louis Beaumont on December 6, 2024, addressed a specific issue within the `screenpipe` application. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. **Version Update:**
   - The version of `screenpipe-app` was incremented from `0.14.26` to `0.14.27` in the `Cargo.toml` file located in `screenpipe-app-tauri/src-tauri`.

2. **Code Changes in Pipe Configuration:**
   - In `screenpipe-core/src/pipes.rs`, a fix was made to how existing pipe configuration is handled. The code was modified to clone the existing JSON configuration if it exists, rather than attempting to parse it again with `serde_json::from_str`.

3. **Logging Condition in the Server:**
   - In `screenpipe-server/src/bin/screenpipe-server.rs`, the logging setup was made conditional. Logging is now only initialized if certain conditions are met when running pipe commands (excluding when commands output in JSON format). A match statement determines whether logging should occur based on the type of command and its output format.

4. **Cosmetic Fix:**
   - Fixed ASCII art rendering in printed output by correcting broken characters in the borders of the display table for visual aesthetics.

Overall, these changes focus on refining existing functionalities, specifically fixing a bug in handling JSON configurations, improving logging conditional logic, and ensuring clean output display.

<summary>summary for commit 16 (7f3c4c9453f8a80e9fc616f21cf6885320e1b884)</summary>

The recent Git commit improved the Windows setup in a GitHub Actions workflow by altering the method used to install LLVM in the `release-app.yml` file. The previous method utilized an action called `KyleMayes/install-llvm-action@v2` to install LLVM. This was replaced with a custom script written in PowerShell that manually handles the installation process:

1. **Permissions and Directories**: The script ensures that the directory `C:\Program Files\LLVM` exists with appropriate permissions by using `sudo mkdir` and `sudo chmod` commands.

2. **LLVM Installer Download and Execution**: The script downloads the LLVM 10.0 installer directly from GitHub releases and runs it silently to install LLVM in the specified directory.

3. **Clean-up and Verification**: It cleans up the installer file after execution and verifies the installation by checking for the existence of `clang.exe` in the LLVM `bin` directory.

These alterations provide a more detailed and explicit installation process suitable for running on Windows with specific permissions and verification steps.
</details>

<details>
<summary>summary for commit 17 (82862ead58d4b702530a456eede9f67c4c9738dd)</summary>

In the commit made by Louis Beaumont, modifications were made to the `release-app.yml` GitHub Actions workflow. Specifically, the changes introduced caching for LLVM on Windows systems. Before installing LLVM and Clang, the workflow now attempts to retrieve a cached version of LLVM, using `actions/cache@v4`. If the cache is not hit, it proceeds with the installation using the `KyleMayes/install-llvm-action@v2`. This change is aimed at optimizing the build process by using the cached LLVM installation when available, thus reducing the need for redundant downloads and installations.

<summary>summary for commit 18 (e24896e51a9e147924ec52e2082fc64d1bd54eaa)</summary>

The commit with ID `e24896e51a9e147924ec52e2082fc64d1bd54eaa` by Louis Beaumont on December 6, 2024, made changes to the GitHub Actions workflow file `release-app.yml`. Here are the key changes:

1. Removed the commented-out trigger configuration for the workflow run on tags matching the pattern `v*`, keeping only the `workflow_dispatch` trigger, which allows manual workflow runs with input parameters.

2. Changed the shell used in multiple steps from `pwsh` (PowerShell Core) to `powershell` (Windows PowerShell) specifically for the step that builds the CLI on Windows.

3. Added `target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` under a job configuration, likely to ensure that the build target is explicitly set.

These changes seem to be aimed at fixing issues with the build process, possibly by using a more suitable shell configuration and ensuring the correct build target is set.

<summary>summary for commit 21 (c637305a7b42663aa93233fff6823e43e48cb887)</summary>

The commit `c637305a7b42663aa93233fff6823e43e48cb887` includes fixes aimed at preventing application crashes. Here are the specific changes:

1. **In `timeline-dock-section.tsx`:**
   - Removed a check that prevented icon fetching on Windows. The lines skipping icon fetching when the operating system is "windows" were deleted, allowing the function `loadAppIcon` to proceed on Windows systems as well.

2. **In `icons.rs`:**
   - Modified the `get_exe_by_reg_key` function to further clean the file path retrieved from the Windows registry. The code now trims quotation marks from around the `cleaned_path` using `trim_matches('"')`, which ensures that the extracted file paths are properly formatted without leading or trailing quotes.

These changes collectively aim to enhance functionality and stability, particularly on Windows platforms, by ensuring icon paths are correctly fetched and formatted, possibly resolving an issue leading to crashes.

<summary>summary for commit 25 (0f3eb12a24a6f1d8cdb6126f3d3b0312e797198a)</summary>

This commit involves significant changes to the GitHub Actions workflow files, particularly the `release-app.yml` file, and the removal of the `steps/action.yml` file. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. **Shell Changes**: 
   - The `shell` key for Mac and Windows platforms has been removed from the job matrix in `release-app.yml`.

2. **Jobs and Steps Restructure**:
   - The steps previously defined in `steps/action.yml` have been integrated directly into `release-app.yml`, thus the `steps/action.yml` file is deleted.
   - This involves actions like setting up Bun, Node, Rust, caching, and more directly within the `release-app.yml`.

3. **Version Update**:
   - Separate steps for updating the version in `Cargo.toml` are provided based on the target platform, using either `pwsh` or `bash`.

4. **Dependency Installation**:
   - Specific installations are now mentioned directly in the CI script (e.g., installing ffmpeg using Homebrew on macOS, setup and installation of Rust tools, 7zip, LLVM and Clang for Windows).

5. **Cache Enhancements**:
   - Extensive caching strategies are in place to optimize build times, including caching of cargo registries, Homebrew packages (for macOS), pre-build caches, and more.

6. **Build Process**:
   - The build steps are now explicitly defined for different platforms (Unix vs. Windows) with platform-specific instructions.

7. **Environment and Secrets**:
   - Enhanced setup for environment variables and secrets management for different build environments, including tauri and Apple signing credentials.

8. **Platform Specific Setup**:
   - Unique setup steps for Windows, such as installing 7zip, LLVM, MSVC, and Python, as well as handling Intel MKL library dependencies.

9. **Asset Upload**:
   - A final step for uploading built assets to CrabNebula Cloud is specified.

This restructuring likely aims to simplify the CI/CD pipeline by placing all steps directly in the main workflow file (`release-app.yml`) for easier maintainability and readability, removing the need for the composite action defined in `steps/action.yml`.

<summary>summary for commit 26 (d1331ea429695a97871692852e6580dfe09658d3)</summary>

The commit by Louis Beaumont updates the `create_router` function in the `server.rs` file of the `screenpipe-server` project. The primary change involves refining the assignment of the `Router` object and conditionally adding a new route. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. **Variable Declaration:**
   - The initial `Router` is now assigned to a `let router` variable instead of being directly returned from the function.

2. **Route Reordering:**
   - `.route("/experimental/frames/merge", post(merge_frames_handler))` was moved before `.layer(cors)` for better organization.

3. **Conditional Route Addition:**
   - A new route, `/experimental/input_control`, is conditionally added if the `experimental` feature is enabled. This route is handled by the `input_control_handler` using the `post` method.

4. **Code Organization:**
   - The function now uses a more structured approach to assembling the router, which makes it easier to read and modify, particularly with feature-specific routes.

Overall, the commit reorganizes how routes are defined and introduces a conditionally compiled experimental route, which could be for handling input control in an experimental setup.
