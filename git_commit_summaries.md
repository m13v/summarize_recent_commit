<summary>summary for commit 5 (4ba73a9d4e836d351fa52b6bd511c612319fd488)</summary>

The commit by Ezra Ellette focuses on fixing issues related to overlapping transcripts in the `screenpipe-server` project. The key changes include:

1. **Handling Empty Transcripts**: 
   - The `current_transcript` is now an `Option<String>` to better handle cases where the transcript might be empty.
   - A check is added to ensure that both `previous` and `current` are not empty before processing them. 
   - The code ensures that the `previous_transcript` is only set if it differs from the existing `previous_transcript`, and similarly for the `current_transcript`.

2. **Refactoring `processed_previous` and `previous_transcript`**:
   - Changed `processed_previous` from a `String` to an `Option<String>` to make it consistent with the new handling of possible empty or null values.
   - Updated `previous_transcript` in `process_audio_result` to be an `Option<String>` to align with the potential for it being empty or uninitialized.

3. **Database Updates**:
   - The logic now safely checks if `previous_transcript` is `Some` before attempting to update the audio transcription in the database, to avoid unnecessary database operations when the transcript is not available.

Overall, the changes ensure that empty or non-existent transcripts are handled gracefully, preventing potential errors or incorrect data processing.

<summary>summary for commit 7 (a6f5bf2490b05fd59e2918f2947837257f291b4a)</summary>

This commit updates the `pre_build.js` script in the `screenpipe-app-tauri` directory. The author, Jan Mechtel, addresses an issue where not all versions of the `wget` command support the `--show-progress` option. The script is modified to handle this by adding a condition specifically for Linux platforms: when running on Linux, it uses `wget` without the `--show-progress` option to download a file, ensuring compatibility with more versions of `wget`. Specifically, it adds a new branch to the conditional logic for handling downloads based on the operating system, defaulting to a version of `wget` with minimized output on Linux.
