<summary>summary for commit 10 (069147c82c299f81720e68dd682f77dc7208865b)</summary>

The commit identified as `069147c82c299f81720e68dd682f77dc7208865b`, made by Louis Beaumont, addresses issue #926 by implementing fixes related to the automatic destruction of Windows CLI. The changes include:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow (`release-app.yml`):**
   - The maximum number of retries (`MAX_RETRIES`) for a process has been increased from 3 to 5.
   - The delay between retries (`RETRY_DELAY`) has been increased from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.

2. **Version Update (`Cargo.toml`):**
   - The version number of the `screenpipe-app` has been incremented from `0.22.4` to `0.22.5`.

3. **Process Watching Enhancement (`auto_destruct.rs`):**
   - Added a function `is_process_alive` specifically for Windows that uses the Windows API to check if a process is still running.
   - Modified the `watch_pid` function to use the new Windows API check before falling back to the existing `Command` approach for process monitoring.
   - This consists of shell commands using `tasklist` to verify both the PID and application name (`screenpipe-app.exe`) on Windows.
   - Enhanced the logic to provide additional process termination checks to ensure robust monitoring.

These changes improve the reliability of process termination checks on Windows in the application, ensuring it handles retries more effectively and uses the Windows API for a more dependable process status check.

<summary>summary for commit 11 (e42979135c89decee89e6f6c278f4b5ba9a8fad4)</summary>

The git commit `e42979135c89decee89e6f6c278f4b5ba9a8fad4` by Louis Beaumont includes fixes and updates to benchmark files in the `screenpipe-server` and `screenpipe-vision` projects.

1. **In `screenpipe-server/benches/db_benchmarks.rs`:**
   - Additional `None` parameters were added to a function call within the `setup_large_db` function to enhance or fix its configuration.

2. **In `screenpipe-vision/benches/apple_leak_bench.rs`:**
   - The `cidre::ns` namespace was imported for usage.
   - The `perform_ocr_apple` function call was modified to use a `ns::ArrayMut<ns::String>::with_capacity(0)` as an argument instead of an empty vector.

3. **In `screenpipe-vision/benches/vision_benchmark.rs`:**
   - `Arc` from the `std::sync` library was introduced, and `WindowFilters` from `screenpipe_vision::capture_screenshot_by_window` was imported.
   - The `benchmark_continuous_capture` function now creates `WindowFilters` using `Arc`, and this is passed into the `continuous_capture` function. This change might provide thread-safe shared ownership of `WindowFilters`.
   - The `continuous_capture` function call was adjusted to replace the empty arrays passed for window filters with the `window_filters` object and added a `false` flag at the end.

Overall, these changes seem to address improvements in setup parameters, the use of more appropriate data structures, and refinements to benchmark functions within the project.

<summary>summary for commit 12 (393e1f04781ea88d4946a3af573fb174cb1d500f)</summary>

This commit `393e1f0` made changes primarily to fix and clean up unit tests in a project, involving both audio and vision modules. Here are the key changes:

1. **Audio Module:**
   - Removed unnecessary code related to `output_path` in several files, ensuring that temporary output paths are no longer specified or cloned. This was applied to example files (`stt.rs`) and test files (`accuracy_test.rs` and `core_tests.rs`).
   - Simplified function calls by removing arguments (`output_path`, `true`) that were unnecessary.
   - Adjusted function calls to use an updated interface, such as changing `&audio_input` to `&audio_input.data`.

2. **Vision Module:**
   - Restructured code in `websocket.rs` to use a new `WindowFilters` struct instead of handling ignored and included windows directly.
   - Removed the `window-filtering.rs` example file altogether, likely due to redundancy or integration of its features elsewhere.
   - Changed the visibility of the function `get_apple_languages` in `core.rs` to be `pub`, allowing it to be used outside of its current module.
   - Updated `apple_vision_test.rs` to include testing for both English and Chinese languages using `perform_ocr_apple`. The test confirms that OCR tasks identify specific keywords from images, using a new approach to handle language configurations.

Overall, the commit streamlines the test setup, enhances the flexibility of handling language settings, and removes deprecated or inefficient code paths.

<summary>summary for commit 15 (ee6bf72f5dd9b6fd5df3978c59389cac9fd9c1c8)</summary>

The commit by Louis Beaumont focuses on fixing the build for the "memories" component. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. **package.json Updates**: 
   - Removed `eslint` and `eslint-config-next` dependencies.
   - `bun-types` remains as `latest`, and `typescript` still uses version `^5`.

2. **Memories Gallery Component (`memories-gallery.tsx`)**:
   - The `newMemories` array is now explicitly typed as `any[]`.
   - Added multiple `@ts-ignore` comments to ignore TypeScript errors possibly related to `item.content.frameId`, `item.content.timestamp`, `item.content.filePath`, `item.content.appName`, and using `item.content.text`.
   
3. **Breaking Changes Instructions Dialog (`breaking-changes-instructions-dialog.tsx`)**:
   - Combined the asynchronous `init` function with the logic to fetch pipe data. It now initializes and also checks pipes within a single `useEffect`, reducing redundancy.
   
4. **Pipe Store Component (`pipe-store.tsx`)**:
   - Removed a block of code involving an `iframe` that displayed content based on `selectedPipe.config.port`. This might have been unused or causing layout/build issues.

These changes aim to improve the component's stability or address specific build errors, especially related to TypeScript configurations and dependencies.
