<summary>summary for commit 2 (8f7c8842a6ff1aa6e28fbe4508ae1d020947113a)</summary>

The commit by Louis Beaumont with the hash `8f7c8842a6ff1aa6e28fbe4508ae1d020947113a` includes the following changes to the project:

1. **Modifications in `pre_build.js`:**
   - Added logic to handle setup for both `arm64` and `x86_64` architectures on macOS.
   - Introduced an array of architectures and iterated over each to perform respective setup actions.
   - For both architectures, checks for the most recent binary paths and copies the appropriate binary.
   - Utilizes `install_name_tool` to modify dylib paths for binaries depending on whether it's in development mode or not, with appropriate error handling.

2. **Changes in `build.rs`:**
   - Large sections of code related to copying binaries and modifying dylib paths for both `x86_64` and `aarch64` targets were commented out.
   - This seems to indicate a shift from handling these operations in `build.rs` to handling them within the updated `pre_build.js` script.

Overall, these changes focus on improving the build process, specifically for macOS environments, by managing binary setup and dynamic library path adjustments more dynamically and effectively in the pre-build step.

<summary>summary for commit 3 (d978e35a56cf4e0596438dd9d2a5bb6d57e37d75)</summary>

This git commit by Louis Beaumont with the message "fix: build" includes several changes across multiple files in the `screenpipe-app-tauri` project:

1. **TypeScript/React Components:**
   - In `layout.tsx`, `auth.tsx`, `pipe-store.tsx`, and `stripe-subscription-button.tsx`, the import of Clerk has been switched from `@clerk/nextjs` to `@clerk/clerk-react`.
   - The `"use client";` directive was added to some of these files, indicating these components should run on the client side.

2. **Configuration:**
   - `next.config.mjs` was updated to include an `images` property with `unoptimized: true`.

3. **Dependencies:**
   - In `package.json`, the dependency on `@clerk/nextjs` was replaced with `@clerk/clerk-react`, and its version has been changed from `^6.5.1` to `^5.17.1`.

4. **Other Files:**
   - The `bun.lockb` file shows binary changes.
   - The version in `Cargo.toml` was incremented from `0.14.9` to `0.14.10`.

These changes appear to adjust the build to use a different Clerk package across components, add a client-side directive, adjust configuration settings for image optimization, and update versions to reflect these changes.

<summary>summary for commit 5 (22105fe48a3be858c7be95d901af0aec2d8e39f1)</summary>

The recent commit introduces several changes and enhancements to the project:

### Features:
1. **Authentication with Clerk**: 
   - Integrated `Clerk` for authentication in `screenpipe-app-tauri`. This is reflected through imports and usage in components like `layout.tsx`, `auth.tsx`, and `settings.tsx`.
   - Introduced `ClerkProvider` and related authentication components (`SignInButton`, `SignOutButton`) for handling user sign-in and sign-out, with specific UI updates to include Clerk's authentication.

2. **Stripe Subscription**:
   - Added a feature for Stripe subscription to enable specific functionalities, like using the "Loom pipe". This involves the integration of a new `StripeSubscriptionButton` component and handling of subscription states.

3. **UI and Component Updates**:

   - Implementation of a subscription-based model to enable certain features based on user subscriptions.

4. **External Plugin & Service Integration**:
   - Introduced `posthog` for analytics within several components, allowing for capturing and identifying user actions and states.

### Fixes and Modifications:
1. **Pipe Store Command**: 
   - Fixed the method of fetching, enabling, disabling, and updating pipes to utilize HTTP requests over direct command execution, shifting from a direct command-line interface to a more network-service based approach.

2. **Removed Unused Configurations**:
   - Cleaned up Rust target-specific configurations in `.cargo/config.toml`, specifically removing unnecessary entries for Apple platforms.

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Upgraded and added dependencies related to dual-auth integrations and Stripe payments within `package-lock.json` and `package.json`.
   - Removed unused packages and updated several `@radix-ui` packages to their latest versions.

### Build and Architecture:
1. **macOS Build Process**:
   - Simplified build scripts in `pre_build.js` and `build.rs` by removing redundant steps and updating the handling of macOS library paths (`dylibs`).

2. **Version Updates**:
   - Updated the project's version in `Cargo.toml` from `0.14.8` to `0.14.9`.

3. **Security Policies**: 
   - Updated the Content Security Policy (CSP) to allow connections and images from new domains related to Clerk and Stripe integration.

These changes collectively enhance authentication, improve user experience through membership subscriptions, and streamline the build and deployment process for macOS while integrating necessary updates to dependencies.

<summary>summary for commit 10 (029101d3330bc2090a6f898758c77a722f8f064f)</summary>

The git commit `029101d3330bc2090a6f898758c77a722f8f064f` introduces updates to the documentation for a feature named "plugins." The changes focus on enhancing the documentation page `plugins.mdx`:

1. **Imports**: Added an import statement for a `Tabs` component (`import Tabs from '@/components/tabs';`).

2. **Content Changes**:
   - Expanded the description of plugins, categorizing "pipes" into two types: 
     - **UI-based**: Uses NextJS for user interaction.
     - **Headless**: Operates in the background without a visual interface, potentially utilizing cron jobs.
   - Removed the previous step-by-step guide for setting up a pipe manually using git, copy, and bun commands.
   - Introduced a fast creation method using a CLI with multi-package manager support (npm, bun, yarn, pnpm). The CLI helps in setting up, testing, and enabling the pipe.

3. **Instructions**: A new section utilizing the `Tabs` component is added to demonstrate how to create a new pipe using different package managers, with commands wrapped in `copy` blocks for easy copying. Users are guided to follow the CLI instructions to set up and enable the pipe.

These updates streamline the process of creating and managing plugins, emphasizing the use of a CLI tool for simplicity and versatility, and highlighting the different ways pipes can be implemented within the system.

<summary>summary for commit 15 (aaa45d135c3023bad16ca9abab47c5cd7033a9a0)</summary>

This git commit introduces a new feature that adds a "pipe for loom". Here's a summary of the changes:

1. **Project Structure:**
   - A new example project named `pipe-for-loom` has been added under `examples/typescript/`.
   - Several configuration files are introduced, including `.eslintrc.json`, `.gitignore`, `package.json`, and `postcss.config.mjs`.
   - `tailwind.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` set up Tailwind CSS and TypeScript respectively.

2. **Core Files:**
   - **API**: A file API route (`app/api/file/route.ts`) is implemented for fetching video or audio files, with error handling for file access permissions, existence, and type support.
   - **Components**: Numerous React components have been added, including `Pipe`, `Header`, `DateTimePicker`, `Toaster`, and various UI components for buttons, badges, dialogs, etc.
   - `global.css` applies global styles using Tailwind CSS and includes root color variables for both light and dark themes.

3. **Functionality:**
   - **Video and Audio Handling**: Ability to merge video and audio files using a server API. Time filters (last 30/60 mins, 12/24 hours) help select content duration for merging.
   - **UI Enhancements**: A user interface is provided to manage videos and audios, including setting start and end times using a date-time picker and viewing merged output in dialogs with video/audio players.
   - **Notifications**: A toast notification system is implemented to provide user feedback on actions like errors in merging.

4. **Server Logic:**
   - Videos are validated using `ffmpeg` for errors before attempting to merge.
   - Error handling is added in the server's video utilities (`src/video_utils.rs`), including validation of videos and handling of directory creation failures.

5. **Dependencies:**
   - The project makes use of several external libraries, such as Radix UI, Date-fns, and Tailwind CSS. Dependencies are added for these libraries in `package.json`.

Overall, this commit establishes the initial setup for a feature that supports fetching, validating, and merging video and audio files with a user-friendly frontend.
