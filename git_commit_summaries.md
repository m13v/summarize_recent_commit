<summary>summary for commit 1 (ffd0d5b4c1abec736003883bed085598c327518f)</summary>

The git commit made by Louis Beaumont on October 25, 2024, updates the `getting-started.mdx` file in the project documentation. The key changes include:

1. **Removal of TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY**: The commands for building the Tauri app have been modified by removing `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY=""` from the `bun tauri build` command. This change was applied in multiple instances throughout the file.

2. **Addition of Troubleshooting Section**: A new section titled "troubleshooting" has been added. It provides guidance on how to handle key signing issues. It includes a link to the Tauri documentation about signing updates, which is important for securing builds and updates.

These changes streamline the build instructions and provide additional guidance to developers facing key signing issues.

<summary>summary for commit 2 (86201ddc73e099f9997ff39cc2187cec702ed815)</summary>

The git commit with the hash `86201ddc73e099f9997ff39cc2187cec702ed815` by Louis Beaumont updates the `getting-started.mdx` documentation. The changes involve modifying multiple instances of the command used to build a Tauri project. Previously, the command included a specific configuration to disable the updater plugin (`--config '{"plugins": {"updater": {"active": false}}}'`). The updated documentation replaces this with the use of an environment variable `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY=""` before invoking the build command `bun tauri build`. This change appears several times in the file for different build steps or scenarios.

<summary>summary for commit 3 (1632a4e02bd95e7e1076bb8cc787bc078010d576)</summary>

The recent commit by Louis Beaumont updates the `getting-started.mdx` documentation file. The primary change across multiple locations in the document involves updating the command to build the project using Tauri. Specifically, the command `bun tauri build` is modified to include a configuration option: `bun tauri build --config '{"plugins": {"updater": {"active": false}}}'`. This change sets the updater plugin to be inactive during the build process. Other lines in the file remain unchanged.

<summary>summary for commit 4 (19687bd08ee35284c849fd8844dad11d578d0119)</summary>

The commit `19687bd08ee35284c849fd8844dad11d578d0119` by Louis Beaumont updates the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. Specifically, it adds a new section under "additional notes" that advises contributors to try and keep files small, ideally under 600 lines of code. The reason given is that AI performs poorly with larger files, and it's also beneficial for human readability and efficiency.

<summary>summary for commit 5 (cf2b374a65252734f840fc6430e8221d6c5a4bda)</summary>

The git commit cf2b374a65252734f840fc6430e8221d6c5a4bda introduces a check and fallback mechanism to handle shortcut settings in the application to prevent it from crashing. The changes include:

1. **Version Update**: The version of the application is updated from 0.7.5 to 0.7.6 in the `Cargo.toml` file.

2. **Default Shortcut Definition**: A constant `DEFAULT_SHORTCUT` is defined with the value `"Super+Alt+S"`.

3. **Shortcut Handling Logic**:
   - All existing shortcuts are unregistered. If there's an error, it logs the failure but continues execution.
   - It tries to parse the `new_shortcut` string into a `Shortcut`. If parsing fails, it logs the error and falls back to using the `DEFAULT_SHORTCUT`.
   - The parsed shortcut (either `new_shortcut` or the default) is registered. If this registration fails, it logs the error and attempts to register the default shortcut as a fallback.
   - If both attempts to set a shortcut fail, it returns an error indicating that the shortcut was reverted to the default.

These changes provide robustness in the application's shortcut handling by ensuring that if an invalid shortcut is provided or any issue arises, the application falls back to a default shortcut instead of crashing.

<summary>summary for commit 6 (ec6ba71dbcb2c77e5e79ea19469d3bbbf3797224)</summary>

The commit `ec6ba71dbcb2c77e5e79ea19469d3bbbf3797224` introduces changes to ensure that video chunks and frames are properly inserted into the database with an association to a specific device name. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. **Function Modifications (Code Logic Change):**
   - Updated `insert_video_chunk` and `insert_frame` methods in `DatabaseManager` to accept an additional parameter `device_name`.
   - These functions now include this `device_name` parameter when inserting records into the `video_chunks` table and identifying video chunks associated with the specific device.
  
2. **Code Updates:**
   - Modified multiple places in the code—such as the database benchmark, core functionalities, and various test files—to pass the `device_name` parameter while calling `insert_video_chunk` and `insert_frame`.

3. **Database Schema Update:**
   - Added a new migration script (`20241024181218_add_device_name_to_chunks.sql`) which alters the `video_chunks` table to include a new column `device_name`.

4. **Tests and Benchmarks:**
   - Revised test setups and associated function calls throughout the testing files to include the `device_name` when inserting video chunks and frames.

These changes are intended to ensure that all video chunks and frames can be correctly associated with a specific device, providing better context and allowing for device-specific processing or queries.

4. **Database Enhancements**:
   - **Commit `ec6ba71dbcb2c77e5e79ea19469d3bbbf3797224`**: Updated database methods and schema to include a `device_name` column. Modified code and tests to support this change, allowing for better association and context in handling video data related to specific devices.

These changes collectively improve build processes, enhance documentation, ensure application stability, and enhance database functionality to accommodate device-specific operations.
