<summary>summary for commit 1 (c11310e2227398150693cab6e39e1ec2ca2b5e45)</summary>

The recent commit introduces several changes primarily focused on adding a "Reset Settings" button feature within the application, as detailed below:

1. **Frontend Changes:**
   - Added a "Reset Settings" button in the `Settings.tsx` component. The button is linked to a new function `handleResetSettings`, which resets user settings to their default values and shows a notification indicating the success or failure of the action.
   - Adjustments in the import statements to include necessary UI components.
   - The `Settings` component now uses a `resetSettings` function from the `useSettings` hook to handle the reset action.

2. **Backend and Hook Changes:**
   - Enhanced `use-settings.tsx`:
     - Added a new `resetSettings` function that resets all settings to default.
     - Refined the loading of settings by introducing `createUserSettings` and `createDefaultSettingsObject` functions, which streamline fetching and preparing default settings based on the platform (macOS, Windows, Linux).
     - Added constants for default ignored windows across operating systems for better code organization and maintainability.

3. **Additional Permissions:**
   - Updated Tauri's filesystem permissions in `capabilities/main.json` and `capabilities.json` to allow the removal of files ("fs:allow-remove"), which may be required for resetting settings.

4. **Refactoring and Code Cleanup:**
   - Minor refactoring with renaming variables and use of constants for better code readability and maintenance.
   - Removed unused imports and console logs for a cleaner codebase.
   - Ensured proper handling of dynamic settings and better error management during the settings reset and load process.

Overall, these changes enhance user experience by allowing the restoration of default settings and ensure compatibility across different operating systems with necessary permissions adjustments.
