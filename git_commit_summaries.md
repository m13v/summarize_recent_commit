<summary>Summary for commit 6 (2bd6c73d47c875c4b3558ab12b59cb4198441b8c)</summary>

The commit by Louis Beaumont introduces several changes to the `screenpipe-server` and `screenpipe-vision` codebase to address feature #295. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. **Multi-Monitor Support:**
   - The CLI option for specifying a monitor (`monitor_id`) has been updated to support multiple monitors (`monitor_ids`), changing from a single `Option<u32>` to a `Vec<u32>`.

2. **Code Adjustments for Multi-Monitor Handling:**
   - The code logic throughout the `screenpipe-server` has been updated to correctly handle multiple monitors.
   - The selection and validation of monitors have been adjusted to iterate through multiple monitor IDs.
   - The video tasks that were previously designed to handle a single monitor now handle multiple monitors by spawning tasks for each monitor.

3. **Refactoring and Cleanup:**
   - Removed unused imports and redundant code.
   - Simplified logic for focused window detection and image capture for efficiency.

4. **Updates in `core.rs` and `capture_screenshot_by_window.rs`:**
   - Introduced the ability to handle multiple monitor IDs during the continuous recording process.
   - Adjusted functions to ensure captured images and recorded data are correctly managed for each monitor.
   - Improved error handling to differentiate between errors that occur on different monitors.
   - Removed the redundant `get_focused_window` function and moved its logic inline to make code more straightforward and efficient.

5. **CLI Struct Update in `cli.rs`:**
   - Changed the type of `monitor_id` in the `Cli` struct from `Option<u32>` to `Vec<u32>`.

These changes collectively enhance the applicationâ€™s ability to handle multiple monitors, thus improving its flexibility and functionality.

<details>
<summary>Summary for commit 8 (9c2840510681ce33fd7167864100bdae2d504e75)</summary>

The commit `9c2840510681ce33fd7167864100bdae2d504e75` involves merging changes from the `main` branch into the `update-formula-aarch64-apple-darwin-8359d1b40aece31a887f763f7b0317224a8fc1be` branch. The updates involve modifications to the `Formula/screenpipe.rb` file:

<summary>Summary for commit 9 (4eeabfdfa14fa7c678561477d1691b5d4238061c)</summary>

This git change merges a pull request (#299) from the `mediar-ai` repository into the current branch. The changes in the pull request include an update to the Homebrew formula specifically for the `x86_64-apple-darwin` architecture. The commit was authored by Louis Beaumont on September 9, 2024.

<summary>Summary for commit 10 (3f0306f632ce34ae57bb85f2f2f55c3e47a84458)</summary>

The git commit titled "fix benchmark" by Louis Beaumont involves a small but crucial modification in the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) benchmark code. Specifically, the change is in the `screenpipe-vision/benches/ocr_benchmark.rs` file:

- The code inside the `bench_windows_ocr` function has been updated.
- Previously, the OCR result was obtained with the line:
  ```rust
  let (result, _, _) = perform_ocr_windows(black_box(&image)).await;
  ```
- This line has been changed to unwrap the result:
  ```rust
  let (result, _, _) = perform_ocr_windows(black_box(&image)).await.unwrap();
  ```

The update ensures that the `perform_ocr_windows` function call now explicitly handles the result by unwrapping it, which likely prevents potential errors related to handling `Result` or `Option` types in Rust. This fix aims to improve the stability and accuracy calculations within the benchmark process by ensuring successful OCR operation results.

<summary>Summary for commit 14 (072052d07cd294882aac3ab4fd60c53244afaa05)</summary>

The commit `072052d07cd294882aac3ab4fd60c53244afaa05` by Louis Beaumont on September 9, 2024, introduces a new feature to the `recording-settings.tsx` component within the `screenpipe-app-tauri` example application. The feature adds explanations to tooltip contents for settings that deal with including or ignoring specific windows during screen recording. The messages now provide examples to clarify how case-insensitive window name matching works:

- For ignored windows: Examples include how "bit" will ignore "Bitwarden" and "bittorrent," and "incognito" will ignore any tabs or windows containing "incognito."
- For included windows: Examples include how "chrome" will match "Google Chrome," and "bitwarden" will match both "Bitwarden" and "bittorrent."

<summary>Summary for commit 16 (794f1997a8b294bd66e061ce74f729fa814d32b6)</summary>

This commit introduces the feature to include or ignore specific windows, applications, or tabs in screen recording functionalities for the `screenpipe` project.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Version Update:**
   - Updated the version in `Cargo.toml` from `0.1.79` to `0.1.80`.

2. **CLI Extension:**
   - Added two new command-line arguments in `screenpipe-server/src/cli.rs`:
     - `ignored_windows`: Accepts a list of window titles to ignore.
     - `included_windows`: Accepts a list of window titles to include.

3. **Core Application Modifications:**
   - Updated several functions (e.g., `start_continuous_recording`, `record_video`) in `screenpipe-server/src/core.rs` to handle the new `ignored_windows` and `include_windows` parameters.
   - Passed these parameters to the `VideoCapture` struct and related functions to apply the inclusion/exclusion logic.

4. **Video Capture Adjustments:**
   - Modified `screenpipe-server/src/video.rs` to propagate the ignore and include lists.
   - Adjusted the `VideoCapture` struct to incorporate these lists, influencing which windows to capture.

5. **Utility and Monitoring Adaptations:**
   - Updated the `capture_screenshot` function signature in `screenpipe-vision/src/utils.rs` to include ignore and include lists.
   - Added logic in `capture_all_visible_windows` and `is_valid_window` functions in `screenpipe-vision/src/capture_screenshot_by_window.rs` to respect the ignore and include lists during window capture.

6. **Example and Benchmark Adjustments:**
   - Added a new example (`window-filtering.rs`) demonstrating how to use the new CLI arguments for window filtering in `screenpipe-vision/examples`.
   - Updated the existing examples and benchmarks to handle the new parameters with empty defaults (`[]`).

Overall, these changes help control which windows or applications are included in or ignored from screen recordings based on their window titles, adding significant flexibility for users.
