<summary>summary for commit 4 (70736bc30aee60decd724496de4711cc31f51bf8)</summary>

The commit focuses on optimizing the `is_valid_window()` function in the `capture_screenshot_by_window.rs` file. The primary improvements are:

- Implementing early returns for simpler checks to bypass unnecessary processing.
- Caching lowercase conversions of the window's app name and title to avoid repeated memory allocations.
- Restructuring the logic to prioritize checking the ignore list, allowing the function to exit early if a match is found, reducing further unnecessary processing.
- Bypassing the include list processing if it is empty, thereby simplifying the logic.

These changes do not alter the function's behavior but enhance its performance by minimizing redundant operations and string manipulations.
