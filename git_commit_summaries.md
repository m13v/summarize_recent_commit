<summary>Summary for commit 1 (cdf0a826033d21c8c19798ca530530e60ca2a7bb)</summary>

The commit by Louis Beaumont on Sep 13, 2024, includes changes to two files and an update to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` documentation, focusing on fixing issues related to Windows pipes:

1. **CONTRIBUTING.md**:
   - Added a new section under "Additional Notes" detailing an AI system prompt used to assist with coding tasks, specifying guidelines and conventions for Rust and NextJS development.

2. **screenpipe-core/src/pipes.rs**:
   - Modified error handling for GitHub URL parsing within the `pipes` module. The URL parsing function now includes a more specific error message using `anyhow::anyhow!`.

3. **screenpipe-server/src/pipe_manager.rs**:
   - Improved URL handling for the `download_pipe` method in the `PipeManager` implementation. Surrounding quotes are removed, and backslashes are replaced with forward slashes to normalize the URL before downloading the pipe.

<summary>Summary for commit 11 (da51517dad100e3fcdd2a5dac9fd9040d44d59cd)</summary>

The commit with ID `da51517dad100e3fcdd2a5dac9fd9040d44d59cd`, authored by Louis Beaumont on Thu Sep 12, 2024, primarily addresses issue #277 by implementing the following changes:

1. **Dependency Update**:
   - Added `tracing` as a dependency in `screenpipe-audio/Cargo.toml`.

2. **Core Function Modifications**:
   - Various `.rs` files in `screenpipe-audio` have been updated to handle audio data differently:
     - Removed usage of audio file paths in favor of directly handling audio data in memory.
     - Simplified the `record_and_transcribe` function to remove direct file output handling. Instead, it now accumulates the audio data in memory.

3. **New Functionality**:
   - Added a new module `screenpipe-audio/src/encode.rs` that provides functionality (`encode_single_audio`) to encode audio data using FFmpeg directly from memory.

4. **Behavior Changes**:
   - Modified the `create_whisper_channel` method to use audio data directly rather than file paths.
   - Updated `screenpipe-audio/src/stt.rs` to use new AudioInput structure and to call `encode_single_audio` for FFmpeg processing.
   - Adjusted the core logic to manage audio in-memory, reducing file I/O operations during the transcription process.

5. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Removed unused code and streamlined functions, especially those dealing with FFmpeg processes and temporary file handling.

These changes collectively enhance how audio data is handled by improving performance, reducing the reliance on temporary files, and potentially improving thread safety and resource management.
