<summary>summary for commit 1 (2ff0a4a10e73780742c8206694390219af386daa)</summary>

The git commit with hash `2ff0a4a` by Louis Beaumont contains changes aimed at fixing the UI. The specific changes are:

1. **Version Update:**
   - The version of the `screenpipe-app` package in `Cargo.toml` was updated from `0.11.7` to `0.11.8`.

2. **Code Refactoring in `run_ui_monitoring_macos.rs`:**
   - The `tokio::process::Command`, `tokio::io::{AsyncBufReadExt, BufReader}`, and `std::process::Stdio` imports have been reordered for consistency.
   - The `log` imports were reformatted to consolidate them into one line.
   - Simplified the determination of the binary name by directly setting `binary_name` to `"ui_monitor"` instead of branching with `cfg!(target_arch)`.
   - Ensured the end of the file has a newline character. 

Overall, the commit includes a version increment and some refactoring of the Rust code for clarity and potential performance improvement.

<summary>summary for commit 2 (4a021800c23196b23c4fde1831419778798704f3)</summary>

The commit message indicates that build issues related to `libknf` were fixed. Specifically, the following changes were made:

- In the `Cargo.toml` file for the `screenpipe-audio` project, the source of the `knf-rs` dependency was updated. The Git URL for `knf-rs` was changed from `https://github.com/thewh1teagle/knf-rs.git` to `https://github.com/Neptune650/knf-rs.git`.

This update may have been required to resolve the build errors, possibly because the new repository provides a corrected or updated version of the library.

<summary>summary for commit 3 (c5bc3719daf6b6870bfdf84e931ef0d91aec67f7)</summary>

The commit with hash `c5bc3719daf6b6870bfdf84e931ef0d91aec67f7` authored by Louis Beaumont removes support for building a Linux version of the application in the GitHub Actions workflow. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. **Workflow Updates**:
   - The `publish-tauri` job for Linux has been removed from the `.github/workflows/release-app.yml` file. Previously, there was a section dedicated to running builds on Ubuntu 22.04 which has now been deleted.
   - Sections that defined Linux-specific build arguments and the installation of Linux dependencies have been removed. This includes removing the job steps for installing various packages needed specifically for Linux builds.

2. **Unused Sections Removed**:
   - Sections related to freeing disk space on Ubuntu were entirely removed.
   - Lines with conditional logic specific to Ubuntu in the build environment variables have been simplified to remove references to the Linux platform.

3. **General Streamlining**:
   - The workflow has been aligned to only support macOS and Windows builds moving forward.

These changes suggest a decision to streamline the build process by focusing only on macOS and Windows, citing reasons like high effort and low interest in maintaining Linux support.

<summary>summary for commit 4 (59b325bab4c506131f2db710a00bb8f0e93a3283)</summary>

The Git commit made by Louis Beaumont on November 22, 2024, includes the following changes related to build fixes in two Cargo.toml files:

1. **screenpipe-app-tauri/src-tauri/Cargo.toml**:
   - The version of the package `screenpipe-app` has been incremented from `0.11.6` to `0.11.7`.

2. **screenpipe-audio/Cargo.toml**:
   - Added a new dependency `ort-sys` with the version `2.0.0-rc.8`. 

These changes suggest a version update in one package and the addition of a necessary dependency for another, likely to address issues during the build process.
